Security Monitoring Tool is a Mini-SIEM system that detects login-based security threats and explains them using Generative AI. It processes authentication logs, identifies suspicious activity, assigns severity levels, and uses a local LLM to generate SOC-style human-readable analysis—all without relying on paid cloud APIs.
